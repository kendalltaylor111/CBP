Constraint-Based Physicalism

The Python script cbp_simulation.py generates the simulation data reported in Section 6 of the Constraint-Based Physicalism (CBP) paper. It tests scaling convergence across N=64K, 256K, and 1M samples. Run with Python 3.8+ and dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

How to Read This Paper (CBP v10.pdf):

This paper does not attempt to derive subjective experience from neural activity, solve the Hard Problem in the reductive sense, or identify a neural correlate of  consciousness. Instead, it examines a hidden assumption shared by both physicalists and anti-physicalists: that a complete physical description is exhausted by structural configuration. The central claim is conditional: If certain dynamically maintained processes are required for the physical existence of organisms like us, then a "behaviorally identical but experientially empty" duplicate is not physically well-defined. The paper therefore does not argue: "this mechanism produces consciousness." It argues: "once the relevant physical facts are specified, the subtraction performed by the zombie argument has no remaining target." Beyond this, the paper offers an error theory for the hard problem itself: the explanatory gap is a compression artifact generated by the bandwidth disparity between continuous processes and discrete descriptions; a gap in description, not in ontology. The paper then develops one candidate for such processes: thalamocortical phase dynamics under metabolic constraints.
